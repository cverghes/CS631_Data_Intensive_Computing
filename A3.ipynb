        "For this assignment, you will be using Python and Spark to perform some graph analysis, using a graph of the Gnutella server network.   In this graph, each node represents a server, and each (directed) edge represents a connection between servers in Gnutella's peer-to-peer network.  The input file for this assignment, `p2p-Gnutella08-adj.txt`, represents the graph as an adjacency list.   Each server (node) is identified by a unique number, and each line in the file gives the adjacency list for a single server.\n",
        "For example, this line:\n",
        "> 91\t243\t1923\t2194\n",
        "\n",
        "gives the adjacency list for server `91`.   It indicates that there are edges from server `91` to servers `243`, `1923`, and `2194`.    According to the Stanford Network Analysis Project, which collected these data, [the graph includes 6301 servers and 20777 edges](http://snap.stanford.edu/data/p2p-Gnutella08.html).\n",

        "- One node in the graph is designated as the *source* node. Personalized page rank is performed with respect to that source node.\n",

        "For the previous question, you implemented personalized page rank that ran for a specified number of iterations.  However, it is also common to write iterative algorithms that run until some specified termination condition is reached.\n",
        "For example, for page rank, suppose the $p_i(x)$ represents the probability mass assigned to node $x$ after the $i$th iteration of the algorithm.  ($p_0(x)$ is the initial probability mass of node $x$.)   We define the change of $x$'s probability mass on the $i$th iteration as $\\lvert p_i(x)-p_{i-1}(x) \\rvert$.   Then, we can iterate personalized page rank until the maximum (over all nodes) change is less than a specified threshold, i.e, until all nodes' page ranks have converged.\n",

Instead of computing the same RDD multiple times, it can be computed once, cached, and then re-used from the cache.   Read about caching in the Spark textbook, or in the [persistence section of the Spark RDD programming guide](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/rdd-programming-guide.html#rdd-persistence).   Caching can be particularly effective for iterative Spark applications, like those you are writing for this assignment.\n",

It should only affect performance.)   Don't worry about different persistence levels.   Just use `cache()`, which caches RDDs at the default persistence level.\n",
