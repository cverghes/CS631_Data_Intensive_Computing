Subsequently, each element in the partitioned RDDs is mapped to its corresponded result creating a new RDD of transformed values using the mathematical function where x represents every element:  $$f(x)=\\frac{(-1)^x}{x!}$$ Following this, RDDs from every worker are reduced(aggregated) , summing every element of the list into a single integer value. Resulting in an equation: $$inverse\\_e=\\sum_{x=0}^{9999} \\frac{(-1)^x}{x!}$$ Lastly, the reciprocal of this value is then assigned to 'e'.\n",

The larger the number of terms summed, the more accurate the estimate. In this case, using 10000 terms gives a reasonably accurate value. The estimated value, as per the Python code, is 2.718281828459044. The accepted value of 'e' is 2.718281828459045, making this approximation extremely close."
